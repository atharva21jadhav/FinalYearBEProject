# FinalYearBEProject
Implemented an Automatic number plate recognition system to authorize vehicles in a residential society.

1: To run this system first of all download the required machine learning models from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DZGw1bR48PlTRuQR_7qhAgNK3qpvRsbX?usp=sharing
and paste in to this directory FinalYearBEProject/django-project/ANPR_System/web/ML_Models (create ML_Models empty folder if not created earlier).

2: To access and use email functionality in the application, go to the path mysite/settings.py, open settings.py file and set EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD variables in compliance with your mailing account credentials.(Make sure to allow third party apps access while running this application).
